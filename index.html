                <h2>I Started Exactly Where You Are</h2>
                <p>I was a first-year at Mills Park — same band room, same nerves, same squeaky high notes you’re dealing with right now. I remember how frustrating it felt when nothing sounded right. But I kept going, and that same dedication turned me into first chair, pre-MPA soloist in front of the Green Level Band, and a selected member of both All-County and All-District Honors Bands.</p>
                <p>That journey taught me exactly what works — and what doesn’t. Now I’m passing every proven step to you, because I know how it feels to want to sound good but not know how. This isn’t just help. This is the shortcut I wish I had.</p>

                <p>I’ve already been through the exact auditions you’re facing. I know the scales, sight-reading, and tone tricks the judges look for because I made it. You get my complete proven system — the one that turned a regular middle-school player into an honors-band member. The preparation that actually works.</p>

Just steady progress that makes you actually enjoy playing — the foundation that changed everything for me.</p>
