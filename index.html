            <div class="about-text">
                <p>Hey friend, I'm Arnav Chouksey — first-chair flutist at Mills Park, soloist in pre-MPA concerts, and a proud member of both All-County and All-District Honors Bands. I've stood on stage in front of the Green Level Band and delivered performances that earned respect from directors and peers alike.</p>
                <p>But here's what matters most to me: I remember exactly how it felt to be a middle-schooler learning flute — the nerves, the squeaks, the excitement when something finally clicked. That's why I'm here. With the same dedication that got me to honors bands, I'll guide you logically from your very first note all the way to audition-ready solos. Most importantly, I'll be your biggest cheerleader, celebrating every win until you feel unstoppable and completely in love with the flute.</p>
