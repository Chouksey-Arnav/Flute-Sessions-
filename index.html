            <p>Hello, I'm Arnav Chouksey, a highly accomplished flute player based in Apex, North Carolina. As the first chair flutist at Mills Park, I've delivered standout solo performances in pre-MPA concerts and showcased my talents before prestigious ensembles like the Green Level Band. My dedication to excellence has earned me selections in both the All-County Honors Band and All-District Honors Band, where I've honed my skills among the region's top young musicians. With a passion for mentoring, I'm committed to helping middle school students in my community elevate their flute playing, build strong fundamentals, and achieve their musical goals with confidence and precision.</p>
