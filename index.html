                <h2>I'm Arnav — Your Personal Flute Coach</h2>
                <p>I was exactly where you are right now — sitting in band class, nervous about solos, frustrated with squeaky notes. Now I'm first chair at Mills Park, I've played solos that got the whole audience hyped at pre-MPA concerts, and I've made All-County and All-District Honors Bands. Everything I learned the hard way, I'm giving to you the easy way.</p>
                <p>We'll build real skills that actually sound good, and I'll be cheering for you the whole time until you start sounding like the player everyone notices.</p>

                <h3>Live Video Sessions</h3>
                <p>One-on-one or small group Google Meets where we actually play together. I'll watch you play, fix your posture, breathing, tone, and fingerings in real time. Beginners get rock-solid basics, intermediates get clean technique, and audition kids get the exact stuff that makes judges go "whoa." Every session ends with you sounding noticeably better — and actually excited to practice.</p>

                <p>I know exactly what the judges want because I've been through it. We'll drill the scales, etudes, and sight-reading that show up every year, plus the tone tricks and mental game that separate the good players from the ones who actually make it. You'll walk into the audition room confident instead of nervous — and you'll sound like you belong there.</p>

                <p>If you're in 6th grade or just starting, this is perfect. We'll go super slow and clear: how to hold the flute without tension, get a strong steady sound, play your first real notes without squeaking, and put together your first songs. No guessing — just steady progress so you actually enjoy playing instead of getting frustrated.</p>

                <p>Your band music is what you play every day — let's make it sound fire. We'll break down the hard parts, fix intonation, work on dynamics and articulation so your section stands out, and even add musical expression that makes your director do a double-take. Perfect for 7th and 8th graders who want to sound pro in class and concerts.</p>
