            <p>Hey there! I'm Arnav Chouksey, an passionate and accomplished flute player from Apex, North Carolina. As the first chair flutist at Mills Park, I've thrilled audiences with standout solo performances in pre-MPA concerts and shared the stage with amazing groups like the Green Level Band. My hard work has led me to selections in both the All-County Honors Band and All-District Honors Band, where I've grown alongside the best young talents in the region. Now, I'm super excited to pass on that passion and knowledge to you! Whether you're just starting out or aiming for the stars, I'm here to cheer you on, help you build unbreakable fundamentals, and watch you achieve incredible musical goals with joy and confidence. Let's make beautiful music together!</p>
