                <h2>I'm Arnav —<br>Your Personal Flute Coach</h2>
                <p>I sat in the exact same band chair you're in right now. I felt the nerves before my first solo, the frustration of squeaky notes, and the pure magic when everything finally clicked. Now I'm first chair at Mills Park, I've performed solos that brought the house down at pre-MPA concerts, and I've earned my spot in both All-County and All-District Honors Bands.</p>
                <p>Everything I learned the hard way, I'm giving to you the easy way — with step-by-step systems that actually work, and the kind of encouragement that makes you excited to practice every single day. You're not just learning flute. You're becoming unstoppable.</p>
